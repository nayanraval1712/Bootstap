                  The character's origin was first depicted in Detective Comics
                  #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that
                  establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven
                  by the murder of his parents. Written by Batman co-creator
                  Bill Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his
                  parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, the
                  child vows that "by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge
                  their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all
                  criminals".[1] Batman's origin is later expanded upon in
                  Batman #47. Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his
                  wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City
                  socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a
                  happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when
                  his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe
                  Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That
                  night, Bruce swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime.
                  He engages in intense intellectual and physical training, but
                  realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. Bruce
                  remarks: "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot, so my
                  disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I
                  must be a creature of the night, black, terrible..." As if
                  responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the
                  window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.[2][better
                  source needed] Batman's origin is expanded upon once again in
                  Detective Comics #235 (June 1956), which recasts the Waynes'
                  murder not as a random mugging, but an assassination. In this
                  story, Batman learns that mob boss Lew Moxon hired Chill to
                  kill the Waynes as revenge for Thomas testifying against him
                  10 years before hand.

                      Gotham City, or simply Gotham, is a fictional city
                      appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics,
                      best known as the home of the Batman and his allies and
                      foes. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane,
                      the city was first identified as Batman's place of
                      residence in Batman #4 (December 1940) and has since been
                      the primary setting for stories featuring the character.
                      Gotham City is traditionally depicted as being located in
                      the U.S. state of New Jersey. Gotham's look and atmosphere
                      was primarily influenced by New York City.Architect Hugh
                      Ferriss’ designs also influenced the look and emotional
                      feel of Gotham City, particularly in its later depictions.
                      Bill Finger said that he chose the name "Gotham", and not
                      New York, so that all readers in any city could identify
                      with it. Locations used as inspiration or filming
                      locations for Gotham City in the live-action Batman films
                      and television series have included St. Louis, Chicago,
                      Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, London,
                      Glasgow, Hong Kong, Detroit, and Liverpool.
